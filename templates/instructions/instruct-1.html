		    In this experiment, you will study alien words paired with unusual objects on a series of slides.
            <b>Your goal is to try to remember which word is paired with each object</b>. <!-- words refer to which objects. (if ambiguous) -->
        </p>
        <p>
            After the study period, you will be asked which object goes with each word.
        </p>

            We are interested in how learning and memory works within healthy individuals.
            <b>Please do not write anything down or use screen recordings.</b>  Just use your mind and intelligence!
        </p>
	    <!-- <p>
		    During the study period, if you notice the same word-object pair repeated on consecutive trials, quickly press SPACE BAR.  This is to make sure you are paying attention.
